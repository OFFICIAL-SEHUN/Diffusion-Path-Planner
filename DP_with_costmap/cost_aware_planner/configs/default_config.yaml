# --- General ---
project_name: "CostAwareDiPPeR"
seed: 42

# --- Data Generation ---
data:
  num_samples: 1000       # Number of map/path pairs to pre-generate for the dataset
  img_size: 64           # Image size (height and width)
  horizon: 128            # Number of points in the trajectory
  sample_per_epoch: 1000  # Number of samples to generate per epoch
  cost_weight: 50.0      # 'w' parameter for cost-aware A* (balances safety vs. length)

# --- Maze Generation ---
maze:
  scale: 4               # Upscaling factor from low-res grid to full-res image
  # Maze generation algorithm doesn't require density, it creates a full maze.
  
# --- Diffusion Model ---
diffusion:
  timesteps: 200
  beta_start: 0.0001
  beta_end: 0.02

# --- Model Architecture ---
model:
  image_feat_dim: 256    # Dimension of the feature vector from the visual encoder
  time_embed_dim: 128    # Dimension for the time embedding
  # ResNet-18 will be used as the base, so specific layer configs are not needed here.
  
# --- Training ---
training:
  epochs: 1000
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.0001
  # Add checkpointing and logging paths
  checkpoint_dir: "checkpoints"
  model_name: "epoch_500_model.pt"
  # Logging interval
  log_interval: 500

# --- Inference ---
inference:
  # No specific params needed other than the trained model path
